# RTJava

Hey there! 👋

Don't mind me, just a chill guy trying to master Java while also making sure that my code doesn’t blow up my computer (or at least trying not to). 🚀

This repository is my humble attempt at learning and growing with Java. From basic classes to more advanced concepts, this repo is where I throw in my ideas, experiments, and projects. Think of it like my Java playground where things might get messy, but hey, that’s how we learn, right? 😉
Features:

    Banking System: A simple banking system to practice Java fundamentals like classes, objects, and methods.

    Transaction Handling: Basic transactions and account management. It's almost like a real bank, but... without the huge profits. 💸

    Java Classes and Objects: I promise they’re less intimidating than they sound!

    General Java Stuff: Everything that gets me one step closer to being a Java pro. 🏆

How to Run:

    Clone this repo to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/theborinprogrammer/RTJAVA.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd RTJAVA

Open your favorite IDE (I personally love VS Code, because who doesn’t?) and run the Java files. Or if you're old-school, run them via the terminal:

    java BankingSystem.java

Hope you enjoy the project and feel free to contribute, fork, or just laugh at my mistakes along the way. I won’t judge! 😅
